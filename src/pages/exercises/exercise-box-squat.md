title: Box Squat
date: 2021-02-11T11:13:03.390Z
instructions: >-
  1. Squat down as you would for regular box squats, pushing your hips back so
  that you land on the box in a controlled manner.


  2. Sit on the box with all of your weight for a second.


  3. Push into your foot to return to the starting position.


  4. That’s one rep. Repeat on the same leg for the first set and then swap.
coachingpoints: "*To make this exercise easier, you can use both legs for the
  second part of the movement. For this tweak, all you need to do is put your
  free leg on the ground whilst you’re sat on the box and then push yourself up
  as explained under ‘how to box squat’ above.*"
